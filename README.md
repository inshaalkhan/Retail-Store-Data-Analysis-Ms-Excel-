I analyzed and visualized data from a retail store using Microsoft Excel. The project involved collecting, organizing, and cleaning extensive datasets to extract valuable insights into the store's performance. Leveraging advanced Excel functions, I conducted thorough data analysis, examining sales trends, inventory turnover, and customer behavior.

The highlight of the project was the creation of a dynamic dashboard using Microsoft Excel. This dashboard encapsulated key performance indicators, allowing stakeholders to interactively explore and understand the data. Through the use of pivot tables, charts, and conditional formatting, I presented actionable information in a visually compelling manner, enabling efficient decision-making for the retail store management.

This project not only demonstrated my proficiency in data analysis using Microsoft Excel but also showcased my ability to translate complex data into accessible and user-friendly visualizations, contributing to a more informed and strategic approach to retail management.
